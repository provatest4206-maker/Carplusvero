CarPlus Manager - Ready-to-build package for GitHub Actions

How to use (from phone or PC):
1. Create a GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload these files into the repository root (main.py, buildozer.spec) and the .github/workflows folder.
3. On GitHub repo page go to 'Actions' tab, choose 'Build Android APK' and click 'Run workflow'.
4. Wait for the workflow to finish (5-30 minutes). Download the APK from the Artifacts section.

If you want the full-featured main.py (with complete UI provided earlier), reply and I'll include it.
